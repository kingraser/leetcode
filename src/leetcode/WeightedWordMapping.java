public class WeightedWordMapping {
    /*
    You are given an array of strings words, where each string represents a word containing lowercase English letters.
    You are also given an integer array weights of length 26, where weights[i] represents the weight of the ith lowercase English letter.
    The weight of a word is defined as the sum of the weights of its characters.
    For each word, take its weight modulo 26 and map the result to a lowercase English letter using reverse alphabetical order (0 -> 'z', 1 -> 'y', ..., 25 -> 'a').
    Return a string formed by concatenating the mapped characters for all words in order.

    Example 1:
    Input: words = ["abcd","def","xyz"], weights = [5,3,12,14,1,2,3,2,10,6,6,9,7,8,7,10,8,9,6,9,9,8,3,7,7,2]
    Output: "rij"
    Explanation:
    The weight of "abcd" is 5 + 3 + 12 + 14 = 34. The result modulo 26 is 34 % 26 = 8, which maps to 'r'.
    The weight of "def" is 14 + 1 + 2 = 17. The result modulo 26 is 17 % 26 = 17, which maps to 'i'.
    The weight of "xyz" is 7 + 7 + 2 = 16. The result modulo 26 is 16 % 26 = 16, which maps to 'j'.
    Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is "rij".

    Example 2:
    Input: words = ["a","b","c"], weights = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    Output: "yyy"
    Explanation:
    Each word has weight 1. The result modulo 26 is 1 % 26 = 1, which maps to 'y'.
    Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is "yyy".

    Example 3:
    Input: words = ["abcd"], weights = [7,5,3,4,3,5,4,9,4,2,2,7,10,2,5,10,6,1,2,2,4,1,3,4,4,5]
    Output: "g"
    Explanation:
    The weight of "abcd" is 7 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 19. The result modulo 26 is 19 % 26 = 19, which maps to 'g'.
    Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is "g".

    Constraints:
    1 <= words.length <= 100
    1 <= words[i].length <= 10
    weights.length == 26
    1 <= weights[i] <= 100
    words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
