public class ElevatorRequestsI {
    /*
    You are given an integer n denoting the number of floors in a building, where the floors are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
    You are also given an integer array requests, where requests represents the sequence of floor requests.
    An elevator starts at floor 0 and follows these rules:
    The elevator moves one floor per second.
    The elevator serves requests in the given order.
    If the elevator is already on the requested floor, no movement is needed.
    After serving a request, the elevator immediately starts moving toward the next request.
    Return the total time in seconds required to serve all requests.

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 5, requests = [2,1,4,3]
    Output: 7
    Explanation:
    requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds.
    requests[1] = 1: Moving from floor 2 to floor 1 takes 1 second.
    requests[2] = 4: Moving from floor 1 to floor 4 takes 3 seconds.
    requests[3] = 3: Moving from floor 4 to floor 3 takes 1 second.
    The total time required is 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7 seconds.

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3, requests = [2,0,0]
    Output: 4
    Explanation:
    requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds.
    requests[1] = 0: Moving from floor 2 to floor 0 takes 2 seconds.
    requests[2] = 0: No movement is needed.
    The total time required is 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 seconds.

    Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 100
    1 <= requests.length <= 100
    0 <= requests[i] <= n - 1
