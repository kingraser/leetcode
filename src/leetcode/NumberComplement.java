  /*
  Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
  The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
  
  Note:  
    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
  
  Example 1:  
  Input: 5
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
  
  Example 2:  
  Input: 1
  Output: 0
  Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
